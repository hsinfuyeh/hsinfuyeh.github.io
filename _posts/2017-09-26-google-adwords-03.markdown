{% highlight ruby %}{% endhighlight %}
<h4></h4>
<h4>AdWords: made up of three layers that each do different things.</h4>
  * Account > Campaigns > Ad groups > Ads <br>

<h4>Targeting on search network</h4>
1. Keyword<br>
2. Location and language<br>
3. Device<br>
4. Audience: remarketing<br>

<h4>Targeting on display network</h4>
1. Audience<br>
   * `Audiences`: depending on your advertising goals, you can choose the audience that best matches prospective customers<br>
   * `Interest catagories`: show ad to people who've demonstrated specific interests.<br>
   * `Remarketing`: reach people who've previously visited your website while they visit other sites on the display network.<br>
   * `Demographic`: reach people who are likely to be within the age, gender, and parental-status demographic groups that you choose.<br>
2. Contextual<br>
   * `Keywords`: words or phrases related to your product or service<br>
   * `Topics`: place your ads on website pages about the topics that you choose<br>
   * `Managed placements`: choose where you'd like your ads to appear based on websites your customers visit on the display network<br>
3. Location and language<br>
4. Device<br>

<h4>Match type</h4>
1. `Broad match`<br>
   * keywords and close variations(synonyms, misspellings, etc)<br>
   * shows ads most broadly with least amount of set up<br>
   * default for all searches<br>
2. `Broad match modifier`<br>
   * same as broad match but excludes synonyms<br>
   * more targeted, can increase clicks and conversions<br>
   * add plus sign (+) before terms<br><br>
3. `Phrase match`<br>
   * exact phrase and close variations<br>
   * more targeted<br>
   * add quotes ("") around term<br>
4. `Exact match`<br>
   * exact keywords and close variations<br>
   * narrows ad's potential audience the most<br>
   * add brackets ([]) around term<br>
5. `Negative match`<br>
   * searches and site visits that exclude keywords<br>
   * prevents ad from showing on unrelated searches or websites<br>
   * add minus sign (-) before terms that should never trigger ads<br>
