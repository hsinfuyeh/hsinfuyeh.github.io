<h3>Google AdWords Basics</h3>
{% highlight ruby %}{% endhighlight %}
<h4>Quality score: whether ad and landing page are relevant and useful to someone looking at ad</h4>
1. `Bid`: maximum amount you are willing to pay for a user to click on your ad and visit your site.<br>
2. `Expected clicktrough rate(CTR)`: the prediction of how often your ad will get clicked when shown for a keyword<br>
3. `Ad landing page experience`: ad is only useful if its landing page helps a user find what they're looking for<br>
4. `Ad relevancy`: a key factor in the auction process, enabling users to see only useful ads that are relevant to the search performed<br>
5. `Ad format`: for example, using various ad extensions like a sitelink, address, or phone number, may serve to bolster your rank<br>

<h4>Ad rank</h4>
* Ad Rank is influenced by three factors: `your bid`, `available ad formats`, and `components of your Quality Score`. Ad Rank matters because it determines your ad position (where ads appear on the page)<br>

<h4>Media cost model</h4>
1. `CPM(cost per thousand impressions)`: pay every time the publisher serves your ad.<br>
   * `raise brand awareness`<br>
2. `CPC(cost per click)`: pay each time someone clicks on your ad, regardless of what happens after the click<br>
   * `drive traffic to my site`<br>
3. `CPA(cost per acquisition)`: pay only if a user sees an ad on the publisher's site and later makes a purchase or completes some other desired action on your site<br>
   * `increase sales`<br>
4. `vCPM(viewable cost per thousand impression)`: pay every time your ad is displayed on screen<br>
   * `raise brand awareness but only pay for impressions measured as viewable`<br>
5. `CPV(cost per view)`: pay for people watching or interacting with your video ad, like clicking on a call-to-action overlay or companion banner ad<br>
   * `increase video views`<br>

`Goal for Build awareness: focusing on impressions - vCPM or CPV`<br>
`Goal for Drive web visits: focusing on clicks - CPC`<br>
`Goal for Drive Online Sales: focusing on conversions - CPA`<br>

<h4>Manage bids</h4>
1. `Manual`<br>
   * when to use: `Small advertising budget`, `want more budget control` or `reworking an underperforming campaign`<br>
   * manual bidding stragegy:<br>
      1) `CPC(cost per clicks)`<br>
      2) `CPV(cost per view)`<br>
      3) `vCPM(viewable cost per impression)`<br>
      4) `CPE(cost per engagement)`: bid to increase light box expansions or interactions with pre-expanded ads<br>
         * [light box][light-box]
2. `Automated`: with automated bidding you can set a daily budget and then have adwords automatically adjust bids to get the most clicks or conversions possible within budget.<br>

<h4>Tools for determine CPC bids</h4>
1. `Bid simulator`: runs "what-if" scenarios like, "how many more impressions would I have gotten if my bid had been $0.10 higher last week"<br>
2. `Keyword Planner`: shows how ofter some keywords get searched, and gives you cost estimates at a glance<br>
3. `First-page bid estimates`: see how much you may need to bid to put your ad on the first page of Google search result<br>
